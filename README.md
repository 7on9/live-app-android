# Live location sharing with HyperTrack
[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/4fad0c93fd3749d690571a7a728ce047)](https://www.codacy.com/app/piyushguptaece/hypertrack-live-android?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android&utm_campaign=badger) [![Slack Status](http://slack.hypertrack.com/badge.svg)](http://slack.hypertrack.com)

If your users can track their Uber coming to them turn-by-turn with an accurate ETA, why not track friends, colleagues, buyers, and sellers similarly! [Facebook Messenger](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/03/introducing-live-location-in-messenger/) and [Google Maps](https://blog.google/products/maps/share-your-trips-and-real-time-location-google-maps/) recently added functionality for live location sharing and Whatsapp is likely to follow soon. Now itâ€™s your turn.
 
This open source repo uses [HyperTrack](https://www.hypertrack.com) to enable location sharing and real-time tracking of your friends and family. Scrape parts of this app to add live location sharing into your own app, or fork the repo and modify it to your own need to build your own brand new app.

## Usage
### To use this as your own app

1. Clone the project.
    
2. Get your HyperTrack API keys [here](https://dashboard.hypertrack.com/signup), and add the publishable key to [gradle.properties](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/gradle.properties) file. Refer to the [Authentication](https://docs.hypertrack.com/gettingstarted/authentication.html) docs to learn more about keys.
    
3. Get [Google Map API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup) and add them to the AndroidManifest.xml.
    
4. For the app to be released on playstore, you will have to change the app's package name.
   - Change the package name in the [AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L4) file.
   - Refactor the name of your package with right click -> refactor -> rename in the tree view, then Android studio will display a window, select "rename package" option.
   - Change manually the application Id in the [build.gradle](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/app/build.gradle#L26) file. Once done, clean and rebuild the project.
        
5. HyperTrack SDKs require FCM integration for enhanced real-time tracking experiences. Refer to our [FCM Integration guide](https://docs.hypertrack.com/sdks/android/guides/gcm-integration.html) for detailed info.
   - Uncomment `HyperTrackLiveFCMListenerService` service tag in the [AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L160) file.
   - Uncomment [HyperTrackLiveFCMListenerService](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/io/hypertrack/sendeta/service/HyperTrackLiveFCMListenerService.java#L35) file.
   - Once you have either an existing account on [Google Developer](https://console.developers.google.com/) or a new account [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com), you will need to add [google-services.json](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592) file for your app to remove the below compilation failure.
   - Uncomment `apply google-services plugin` in [build.gradle](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/app/build.gradle#L75) file.
