This open source repo uses HyperTrack for Live Location Sharing and Activity Tracking. Hypertrack Live helps you share your Live Location with friends through your favorite messaging app when on the way to meet up. You can also see your activities organized as chronological cards so that tapping on each card gives you the locations of the activity.

## Activity Tracking
One of the two core features of Hypertrack Live is Placeline. Placeline is useful in tracking your daily activity with near-zero battery impact. We automagically use the combination of device sensors - GPS, WiFi, network, accelerometer, pedometer, gyroscope, compass - to deliver accuracy. Placeline is powered by the HyperTrack SDK which collects location and activity data for your users. It includes segments like stop üõë, walk üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,drive üèéÔ∏è and cycling üö¥.

## Live Location Sharing
The other core feature of Hypertrack Live is Live Location Sharing. Live Location Sharing is useful for consumer apps like messengers and social apps where two or more people want to share their Live Location with each other when on the way to meet up. It is also useful for marketplace aggregators where the transaction starts online üíªüì± but requires people to meet offline for fulfillment. It helps you solve the consumer's anxiety of ‚Äúwhere are you‚ÅâÔ∏è‚Äù.

## Usage
#### To use this app

1. Clone this repository
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android.git
```

2. Get your HyperTrack API keys [here](https://dashboard.hypertrack.com/signup), and add the publishable key to [key.properties](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/key.properties) file.
```java
HyperTrack.initialize(this.getApplicationContext(), BuildConfig.HYPERTRACK_PK);
```

3. Get the [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup) and add it to [api-keys.xml](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/api-keys.xml).

#### To build Placeline in your app, follow this [tutorial](#build-activity-tracking-in-your-app).
#### To build Live Location Sharing in your app, follow this [tutorial](#build-live-location-sharing-in-your-app).

## Build Activity Tracking in your app 
 - [Placeline format](#placeline-format)
 - [Setup HyperTrack SDK](#setup-hypertrack-sdk)
 - [Create Hypertrack user](#create-hypertrack-user)
 - [Start tracking](#start-tracking)
 - [Get Placeline in your app](#get-placeline-in-your-app)

#### Placeline format
Placeline object contains detailed information about the activity like the start time, end time, location, steps and more.
An example JSON representation is given [here](https://docs.hypertrack.com/gettingstarted/activities.html#placeline).

#### Setup HyperTrack SDK
Set up the HyperTrack SDK by following these [instructions](https://docs.hypertrack.com/sdks/android/setup.html).

#### Create HyperTrack user
The next thing that you need to do is create a HyperTrack User. This would tag the location/activity data to the user and help you get useful filtered data in the form of Placeline. More details about the function [here](https://docs.hypertrack.com/sdks/android/basic.html#step-1-create-sdk-user). 

```java
UserParams userParams = new UserParams()
                .setName(name)
                .setPhone(phoneNumber)
                .setPhoto(encodedImage)
                .setLookupId(phoneNumber);
                
HyperTrack.getOrCreateUser(userParams, new HyperTrackCallback() {
                @Override
                public void onSuccess(@NonNull SuccessResponse successResponse) {
                    // Handle success on getOrCreate user
                    HyperTrack.startTracking();
                }

                @Override
                public void onError(@NonNull ErrorResponse errorResponse) {
                    // Handle error on getOrCreate user
                    Toast.makeText(this, errorResponse.getErrorMessage(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                }
            });
```

#### Start tracking
Start tracking for the created user by calling the following method
```java
HyperTrack.startTracking();
```

#### Get Placeline Data in your app
Once tracking has started, implement the following function [placelineManager.getPlacelineData()](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/io/hypertrack/sendeta/store/PlacelineManager.java#L43) and get [PlacelineData](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/io/hypertrack/sendeta/model/PlacelineData.java) and you are all set to use the rich activity data in your app.

```java
PlacelineManager placelineManager = PlacelineManager.getPlacelineManager(this);
placelineManager.getPlacelineData(userID, date, new HyperTrackCallback() {
        @Override
        public void onSuccess(@NonNull SuccessResponse response) {
            if (response != null) {
                    PlacelineData = (PlacelineData) response.getResponseObject();
            }
        }
        @Override
        public void onError(@NonNull ErrorResponse errorResponse) {
            Log.d("Placeline", "onError: ");
        }
}
```

We hope that you got a good taste of Placeline. If you have any problems or suggestions for the tutorial, do not hesitate to buzz üêù us [here](#support).

## Build Live Location Sharing in your app 

Use the following tutorial to build  [Live Location Sharing](#live-location-sharing) in your app. This is divided into three section.
1. In the first section, we will do a basic setup of Hypertrack SDK. 
2. In the second section, we will select a destination and start a Live Location trip to that place. 
3. In the last section, we will get your friend to join the trip started by you. 

Let's get started üòä . Strap yourself in and get ready for an exciting ride üöÄ .

  - [Track ongoing trip](#step-1-track-ongoing-trip)
  - [Join ongoing trip](#step-2-join-ongoing-trip)

  
### Basic Setup
#### Step 1. Get API keys
Get your HyperTrack API keys [here](https://dashboard.hypertrack.com/signup).

#### Step 2. Use this project
We have created this project so that building Live Location Sharing becomes very easy and quick. It will prevent you from the hassle of creating a new project and the workflow to enable Live Location Sharing. If you want to directly build the flow in your own app or wanted to create a new project, you can ignore this step.

1. Clone this repository
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android.git
```

2. Get your HyperTrack API keys [here](https://dashboard.hypertrack.com/signup), and add the publishable key to [key.properties](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/key.properties) file.
```java
HyperTrack.initialize(this.getApplicationContext(), BuildConfig.HYPERTRACK_PK);
```

3. Get the [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup) and add it to [api-keys.xml](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/api-keys.xml).

#### Step 3. Setup HyperTrack SDK
If you are NOT using the starter project, set up the HyperTrack SDK by following these [instructions](https://docs.hypertrack.com/sdks/android/setup.html). Else, initialize the SDK by putting the following code in [MyApplication.java](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/io/hypertrack/sendeta/MyApplication.java) file.

```java
public class MyApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        
        ...
        
        // Initialize HyperTrack SDK
        HyperTrack.initialize(this.getApplicationContext(), BuildConfig.HYPERTRACK_PK);
    }

```

#### Step 4. Create HyperTrack user
The next thing that you need to do is to create a HyperTrack user. It helps us tag the location/activity data with the user and share their Live Location status with friends. More details about the function [here](https://docs.hypertrack.com/sdks/android/basic.html#step-1-create-sdk-user). 

When the user is created, we need to start tracking his location and activity. Call the following method to do so ```HyperTrack.startTracking()```

For starter project, go to [ProfilePresenter.java](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/io/hypertrack/sendeta/presenter/ProfilePresenter.java). When the user taps login, get the name of the user and use the following function to create a user.

```java
UserParams userParams = new UserParams()
                .setName(name)
                .setPhone(phoneNumber)
                .setPhoto(encodedImage)
                .setLookupId(phoneNumber);
                
HyperTrack.getOrCreateUser(userParams, new HyperTrackCallback() {
                @Override
                public void onSuccess(@NonNull SuccessResponse successResponse) {
                    // Handle success on getOrCreate user
                    HyperTrack.startTracking();
                    Toast.makeText(this, "Yay Hypertrack User is created successfully.", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                }

                @Override
                public void onError(@NonNull ErrorResponse errorResponse) {
                    // Handle error on getOrCreate user
                    Toast.makeText(this, errorResponse.getErrorMessage(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                }
            });
```

### Start a Live Location trip
Are you ready to rock and roll?

#### Step 1. Show Live Location view
Now to start a Live Location trip, the first thing that you need to do is to add a destination. For this, we will need a location picker. The good news is that HyperTrack Location View has a location picker within it. Once the user selects a location with the help of our inbuilt location picker, than the sdk gives a callback to the app with the selected location so that the app can start a trip.

For  starter project, Check ```Home.java``` embedding the HyperTrackMapFragment view in  ```content_home.xml``` view. Initialize the HyperTrackMapFragment inside ```oncreate``` method of ```Home``` activity and set [HyperTrackMapAdapter](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/io/hypertrack/sendeta/view/HomeMapAdapter.java), [MapFragmentCallback](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/6c801e65a628769cd160ef7b0b4f77fd68df7818/app/src/main/java/io/hypertrack/sendeta/view/Home.java#L137-L213) for HyperTrackMapFragment.

```java
MapFragmentCallback callback = new MapFragmentCallback(){
    @Override
    public void onMapReadyCallback(HyperTrackMapFragment hyperTrackMapFragment, GoogleMap map) {
        // Handle onMapReadyCallback API here
    }

    @Override
    public void onExpectedPlaceSelected(Place expectedPlace) {
        // Check if expected place was selected
        if (expectedPlace != null) {
            // Handle selected expectedPlace here
        }
    }
    ...
};
```

```java
htMapFragment = (HyperTrackMapFragment) getSupportFragmentManager()
        .findFragmentById(R.id.htMapfragment);
HomeMapAdapter adapter = new HomeMapAdapter(this);
htMapFragment.setHTMapAdapter(adapter);
htMapFragment.setMapFragmentCallback(callback);
```

Implement this method in the MapFragmentCallback as specified above. You will get a callback when a user selects an expected place using SDK's Place Selector View.
```java
@Override
public void onExpectedPlaceSelected(Place expectedPlace) {
    // Check if expected place was selected
    if (expectedPlace != null) {
        // Handle selected expectedPlace here
    }
}
```

#### Step 2. Create and track action

When the user selects a location, you will get a callback in the ```onExpectedPlaceSelected``` function of your ```MapFragmentCallback``` instance. This is the right time to start a trip. For starting a trip, you need to create a session. This can be achieved by creating a 'visit' [action](https://docs.hypertrack.com/api/entities/action.html).  
You will need two things to create an action. 
1. ```expectedPlace``` - This is the destination for the visit. You have it after you select the destination.
2. ```lookupId``` - A ```lookpupId``` is an identifier created by you for the Live Location trip. A ```lookupId``` is what needs to be shared with the friend, so they can join your trip and share their location. We chose it to be the UUID. You can use your own internal identifiers. 

For starter project, go to [Home.java](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/io/hypertrack/sendeta/view/Home.java#L194-L199) and add the following code when you get a callback of place selection ```onExpectedPlaceSelected```.
```java
ActionParams actionParams = new ActionParamsBuilder()
                .setLookupId(lookupID != null ? lookupID : UUID.randomUUID().toString())
                .setType(Action.ACTION_TYPE_VISIT)
                .setExpectedPlace(expectedPlace)
                .build();

// Call assignAction to start the tracking action
HyperTrack.createAndAssignAction(actionParams, new HyperTrackCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(@NonNull SuccessResponse response) {
        if (response.getResponseObject() != null) {
            Action action = (Action) response.getResponseObject();
            
            // Handle createAndAssign Action API success here
            Toast.makeText(this, "Live Location successful shared back", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(@NonNull ErrorResponse errorResponse) {
        // Handle createAndAssign Action API error here
        Toast.makeText(this, "Live Location successful shared back", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
});
```

Also, allow user to stop sharing his location by handling `stopSharing` method in [HomePresenter.java](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/io/hypertrack/sendeta/presenter/HomePresenter.java) file so the action gets completed when the user taps stop sharing.

```java
HyperTrack.completeAction(actionID);
```

#### Step 3. Share your trip
As described earlier, a ```lookpupId``` is an identifier which identifies a Live Location trip. When you want to share your trip, your trip's ```lookupId``` needs to be shared.

You can share your ```lookupId``` to the other person in different ways. 

1. You can use the Android's ShareCard Intent to share it through messaging apps.
2. You can use your backend to send the ```lookupId```. 

For starter project, let us keep it simple and use Android's ShareCard to do the job for us.
```java
Intent sharingIntent = new Intent(android.content.Intent.ACTION_SEND);
sharingIntent.setType("text/plain");
sharingIntent.putExtra(android.content.Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, shareMessage);
startActivityForResult(Intent.createChooser(sharingIntent, "Share via"),
        Constants.SHARE_REQUEST_CODE);
```

### Track or join an ongoing trip
If you have completed the steps in above section, you have a user who has started a Live Location session. Once their friend receives a ```lookupId``` (either through your own backend or through a messaging app), she can use it to track the user and optionally join the trip if you add a few lines of code as described in the following steps.

#### Step 1. Track ongoing trip
To track the user, use the following function. Although the tracking has started in the SDK, visualizing it requires you to embed HyperTrack's map fragment in your activity containing hypertrack map view. 
```java
HyperTrack.trackActionByLookupId(lookupId, new HyperTrackCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(@NonNull SuccessResponse response) {
        // Handle trackActionByLookupId API success here
    }
 
    @Override
    public void onError(@NonNull ErrorResponse errorResponse) {
        // Handle trackActionByLookupId API error here
    });
```
 
For starter project, you have to enter the ```lookupId``` in the text field that you have received from the user who has started the session. Add the following code in the click of track button ```onTrackSharedLinkButtonClick()```.
 
```java
ActionParams actionParams = new ActionParamsBuilder()
                .setLookupId(lookupID != null ? lookupID : UUID.randomUUID().toString())
                .setType(Action.ACTION_TYPE_VISIT)
                .setExpectedPlace(expectedPlace)
                .build();

// Call assignAction to start the tracking action
HyperTrack.createAndAssignAction(actionParams, new HyperTrackCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(@NonNull SuccessResponse response) {
        if (response.getResponseObject() != null) {
            Action action = (Action) response.getResponseObject();
            
            // Handle createAndAssign Action API success here
            Toast.makeText(this, "Live Location successful shared back", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(@NonNull ErrorResponse errorResponse) {
        // Handle createAndAssign Action API error here
        Toast.makeText(this, "Live Location successful shared back", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
});
```
 
Now to see the result, go to the other device and set up the user. After that click on 'Track a Live Location trip' and paste/enter the ```lookupId``` which you received from the user. 
 
#### Step 2. Join ongoing trip
In this step, we will see how the friend can share her Live Location and join the trip. To join the trip, an action with the same lookupId needs to be created. This step is similar to Step 6. But this time it is a lookupId of an existing trip and NOT a new one in Step 6.

For starter project, add this code to `onShareLiveLocationBack()` when the user taps the 'Share Live Location' button. It creates and assign action for your friends Live Location session.
```java
ActionParams actionParams = new ActionParamsBuilder()
                .setLookupId(lookupID != null ? lookupID : UUID.randomUUID().toString())
                .setType(Action.ACTION_TYPE_VISIT)
                .setExpectedPlace(expectedPlace)
                .build();

// Call assignAction to start the tracking action
HyperTrack.createAndAssignAction(actionParams, new HyperTrackCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(@NonNull SuccessResponse response) {
        if (response.getResponseObject() != null) {
            Action action = (Action) response.getResponseObject();
            
            // Handle createandAssign Action API success here
            Toast.makeText(this, "Live Location successful shared back", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(@NonNull ErrorResponse errorResponse) {
        // Handle createandAssign Action API error here
        Toast.makeText(this, "Live Location successful shared back", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
});
```
