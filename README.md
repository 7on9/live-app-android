# Live location sharing with HyperTrack
[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/4fad0c93fd3749d690571a7a728ce047)](https://www.codacy.com/app/piyushguptaece/hypertrack-live-android?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android&utm_campaign=badger) [![Slack Status](http://slack.hypertrack.com/badge.svg)](http://slack.hypertrack.com)

If your users can track their Uber coming to them turn-by-turn with an accurate ETA, why not track friends, colleagues, buyers and sellers similarly! Facebook Messenger and Google Maps recently added functionality for live location sharing and Whatsapp is likely to follow soon. Now itâ€™s your turn.

Use this open source repo to build live location sharing for your app users.

## Usage
**To use this as your own app:**
    1. Clone the project.
    2. Get your HyperTrack API keys [here](https://dashboard.hypertrack.com/signup), and add the publishable key to [gradle.properties](https://github.com/hypertrack/hypertrack-live-android/blob/master/gradle.properties) file. To get to know more about API keys, refer to the [Authentication](https://docs.hypertrack.com/gettingstarted/authentication.html) section in our documentation.
    3. Get [Google Map API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup) and add them to the AndroidManifest.xml.
    4. HyperTrack SDKs require FCM integration for enhanced realtime tracking experiences. Refer to our [FCM Integration guide](https://docs.hypertrack.com/sdks/android/guides/gcm-integration.html) for detailed info. Once you have either an existing account on [Google Developer](https://console.developers.google.com/) or a new account [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com), you will need to add [google-services.json](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592) file for your app to remove the below compilation failure. 
    
        > Error:Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugGoogleServices'.
        > File google-services.json is missing. The Google Services Plugin cannot function without it.
        > Searched Location:
        > /Users/piyush/StudioProjects/hypertrack-live-android/app/src/debug/google-services.json
        > /Users/piyush/StudioProjects/hypertrack-live-android/app/google-services.json
            
**If you want to build live location sharing within your own app, following this [step-by-step tutorial]((https://www.hypertrack.com/tutorials/live-location-sharing-android-messaging-app)) that walks through how you can embed this code in your app.**
